``htme_globalSet(name,value,datatype)``
--------------

###Description
Stores a real or string value in the global sync list.
Use buffer_type to define the type of the variable.
The global sync list is a list of global variables that can be retrived via htme_globalGet. 

They get synced between all clients and servers
and be read and written by any (unlike instance variables which are read-only for all but the creator).

Make sure the player is connected or a server is running!

**NOTE:** Using this command will sync this variable immediately via [SMART](concepts/synctypes)
