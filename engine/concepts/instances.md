Local and remote Instances
--------------

When you **place an instance of an object into a room**, that is set up to be be **synced via GMnet ENGINE** ([mp_sync();](functions/sync/mp_sync) called in the create-Event), you will have **one local instance of this object in your room**, **and one remote instance for each other player you are connected to**.

That means,** if you place one instance of object A in your room**, you will have** 4 instance if 4 players are playing**. Each player has **one local instance he controls**, and the **three other instances that the other players control**.

You can find out if a instance is local by using [htme_isLocal();](functions/tools/htme_isLocal) by using this if-Statement:

```javascript
if (htme_isLocal()) {
 //Bla
}
```
everything in the statement will only be executed once for every player, by the instance that he controls.

If you place 2 instances of an object into the room, you will have 8 instances with 4 players, of which 2 are local and the above code will be executed by these two instances.
