##16. Bonus 4 - Event Handlers for Connecting/Disconnecting
Sometimes you may want to exceute code when players connect or disconnect. Or you want to prevent players from joining after the game has started.  
In this chapter, we will teach you how you can do that. It is very easy.

###Basic example
Let's say you have this script called ``scr_welcome``:

```gml
show_message("Cool! Someone connected!");
return true; //- We will come to that later
```

You want to execute this script, if someone connects. To do that simply use this code somewhere after the engine was started (obj_htme is created):

```gml
htme_serverEventHandlerConnecting( scr_welcome );
```

That's all you have to do. For a script to be run at disconnection, simply call ``htme_serverEventHandlerDisconnecting`` instead.

###What is the return value for?
As you saw in the example above, the script ``scr_welcome`` returns ``true``.

If you are using a script as an event handler for **connecting** players, you need to return either true or false (you don't have to return anything for the Disconnect-Event).  

When your script returns **true**, the connection is **accepted** and the player is **connected**.  
When your script returns **false**, the connection is **refused** and the player will be **kicked** before he even really connected.

###Getting more information about the player

Both, the disconnect and connect event, provide an argument for your script.

The **connect event** gives your script an argument0 containing a **ds_map** with the keys **port** and **ip**.  
The **disconnect event** also contains this ds_map, but **additionally** has a key **hash** containing the [**player hash**](concepts/playerhashes) that you can also use.

Here is an example how you can use this information. The server will refuse all connections from the local computer when using this script:

```gml
///somewhere in your code
htme_serverEventHandlerConnecting( scr_no_local_clients );
htme_serverEventHandlerDisconnecting( scr_goodbye );
```

```gml
///scr_no_local_clients(player_map);
var player_map = argument0;

if (player_map[? "ip"] == "127.0.0.1") return false;
else {
    show_message("Cool! "+player_map[? "ip"]+":"+string(player_map[? "port"])+" connected!");
    return true;
}
```

```gml
///scr_goodbye(player_map);
var player_map = argument0;

show_message(":( ! "+player_map[? "ip"]+":"+string(player_map[? "port"])+" with the hash "+player_map[? "hash"]+" left!");

```
