##14. Global Sync

The [update to version 1.1](more/update) added a new feature called "Global Sync".

Before you learned how to sync instances between games in this tutorial. However this concept has one downside: **Instances are only created and controlable by one client.** All variables of an instance are **read-only** to all other clients. 
That's why we needed to create a seperate chat instance for each player that basicaly all jut synced one chat variable. That may be fine for a few variables, and in this case maybe even the best way of doing it, since every player still needs one "chat outbox", however **you can now sync global variables that are read- and writeable by all clients at all times.** 

Summary of Global Sync's features:
**Change the value on one end and it will update on all other ends as well. All ends can update and access all variables**

### How it works

It's super simple. **To store a variable** in the Global Sync pool use this little code:

```javascript
var value = 1+1;
htme_globalSet("name",value,buffer_u8);
```

The third argument is the [Buffer type/data type](concepts/buffer).

This will now sync to all clients immediately (using the SMART [syncType](concepts/synctypes).).

You can **retrieve this variable** via this code **on all connected clients and the server**:

```javascript
var value = htme_globalGet("name")
```

Please note that this function may return ``undefined`` if it wasn't set by any of the clients/server yet, so check if it is defined:

```javascript
if (is_undefined((htme_globalGet("name")) {
    //Nope, that wasn't set yet...
}
```
