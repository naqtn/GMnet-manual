##F12: Toggle overlay
F12 will show and hide the overlay when it's enabled.

##F1: All instances
Shows a list of all instances and the [variable groups](concepts/vargroups) for [local instances](concepts/instances).

For the first 10 instances in the list, press SHIFT + the shown number to access instance details.

###Instance details

| Variable | Description |
|--------|--------|
|Hash | The id of the instance as stored by the engine|
|isVisible | Whether or not this is a visible instance|
|isNotCached | True if this instance is in the same room (server only; clients will only show instances in the same room)|
|Persistent|See [Instance scrope and rooms](concepts/scope)|
|stayAlive |See [Instance scrope and rooms](concepts/scope)|
|Instance ID |The local id of the instance, assgined by GameMaker. If cached the instance will not actually exist, and therefor the instance will have no id|
|Object|Name of the object of this instance|
|Player|Number and hash of the player this instance belongs to|
|Saved variables|All variables as synced by the engine
|Vargroups|Details of all [variable groups](concepts/vargroups)|

##F2: Visible instances
Same as F1 but filters by showing only visible instances

##F3: Players
Shows a list of all players, including their player number and their hash. Also shows who is the local player and who runs the server.

Press SHIFT + number shown to show all instances of one player.
If you are the server, press STRG + number to kick a player.

##F4: Invisible instances
Same as F1 but filters by showing only invisible instances

##F5: Instances in cache
Same as F1 but showing only cached instances (instances in same room; This list is always empty for clients).

##F6: Global sync
Shows all variables in the global sync pool.

##F7: CHAT Interface Channels
Lists all [CHAT Interface](./concepts/chat) channels and how many messages haven't been processed (read) and what the content of the most recent unread message is.

##F8: Signed packet queue
Shows details about all [signed packets](concepts/signedpackets) that are not yet recieved by the clients/server.

##F9-F10
*Not implemented yet*.

##F11: Disconnect - Client only
Disconnect from the server. This will tell the server to kick us and then kill the engine.

##Check if overlay is enabled
``htme_debugOverlayEnabled`` will return true when the overlay is enabled. Use this to draw your own debug stuff when the overlay is active.
