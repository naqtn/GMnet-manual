Tolerance
--------------

Using [mp_tolerance](functions/sync/mp_tolerance) you can give each variable that is a real (a number) a tolerance range in that it will not be chanegd locally. This is mainly used to make smooth movement and prevent players from jumping arround a few pixels.

Take as an example the x position:

If the actual x-Position of an instance should be 12 but it's 15 locally, the change will not be applied locally if the tolerance is greater than or equal 3.
