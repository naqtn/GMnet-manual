### Recent updates

#### 1.2.2 - CHAT Interface, Event Handlers, RPCs, MIT License

- LICENSE CHANGED TO MIT  
  Due to confusion about the GPLv3 license, I decided to change the license to the MIT license. This is way easier to understand for everybody. BY UPDATING YOU AGREE TO THIS NEW LICENSE. THIS LICENSE REPLACES THE OLD ONE.
- Support for custom Event Handler for Connection/Disconnection on Server  
  Also adds an easy way to reject players when they conect
- Fixed a bug that prevented the game to be run with the YYC (thanks to Imtnt @gmc)
- Server Shutdown Function added and automatic shutdown/disconnect if the htme object is destroyed / game is ended
- PLUS/UDPHP : UDPHP 1.2.1 - Fixed an issue where servers and client could not connect to each other when the master server was not reachable.
- Added CHAT Interface:  
  This is a new set of functions that allow you to send and recieve string messages in a more clasic way. The manual was updated so the Chat Tutorial now uses this new way of syncing (an RPC tutorial was also added to the manual; see below).
- Updated debug overlay to include debug information about the CHAT Interface
- Fixed a bug, where in rare cases clients could start syncing before they got their player hash which lead to invalid instances being synced and mayor desync
- MANUAL (http://htme.parakoopa.de/manual) : 
   * Added manual pages for the event handler scripts
   * Added Tutorial Chapter Bonus 4 - Event Handlers for Connecting/Disconnecting
   * Added manual page for htme_shutdown
   * Added manual page for htme_globalSyncFAST
   * Added manual page for the CHAT Interface and all it's functions
   * Rewrote Tutorial 11 - Chat (it is now using the CHAT Interface)
   * Added Tutorial Chapter Bonus 5 - RPC

- UDPHP/PLUS: Added support for new registration and sending version number
