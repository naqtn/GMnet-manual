##0. What is HTME?

*HTME* stands for *HappyTear Multiplayer Engine* and allows you to make multiplayer games in *Game Maker: Studio* with nearly zero knowledge in networking.

Everything in *HTME* is done via the key concept of *Game Maker*: **Objects and Instances**.

You simply tell the engine what variables of what object should be synced and how. The engine takes care of sending and recieving the data and the whole client and server architecture.  
This means your game's network functions are easy to use and easy to maintain.

So, let's waste no time, and let's get started with making your very first game with *HTME*.
