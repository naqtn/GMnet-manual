##1. Basic configurationIn this tutorial we want to make a **simple platformer** with some neat little extras to demonstrate what *HTME* can do.Our platformer will have:* Walls/Players/Physics (obviously)* Multiple rooms* An overlay that shows connected players* A night and day cycle* A basic chat system###Adding the engine to a projectBefore we can get started, add the asset to an empty project. Depending on what you want to do, you have three options.  * If you want to **follow this tutorial yourself**, you should add **ALL scripts and sprites and the object ``obj_htme``** to your project.  * If you want to just **read through this tutorial** and test the demo game, **simply add everything**. Also add the room *udphhtme_lobby* and the object *obj_udphphtme_lobby* from ***UDPHP*** when using ***UDPHP*** and ***HTME*** as seperate assets!  * When starting completely blank or when you want to **add the engine to your own game**, add all **folders named *htme*** (and ***udphp*** when using the *PLUS* version) but **not the *htme_demo* folders**. When using ***UDPHP*** and ***HTME*** as seperate assets only add the script files of ***UDPHP***.###ConfigurationGreat! No matter what option you chose, you propably want to take a look at the configuration, so let me walk you through.**The configuration can be found in ``scripts/htme/htme_init``**. The first things in this configurations are the enums that are used by the engine. Just ignore them and jump straight to ``CONFIGURATION``.The first thing you'll find under configuration is ``randomize();``. That assures that the random operations Game Maker does are truly random, which is important for the engine.After that you can set the **debug level**. Valid options can be found in the enum ``htme_debug`` and how debugging works is explained in the comment. Leave it on the default option for now.Let's skip ahead to **``self.global_timeout``**. That's actually the only important configuration option and even that can stay on default if you want. Timeout specifies after how many steps of inactivity the connection between client and server will die and you will be disconnected. The default is ``5*room_speed`` which basicly means 5 seconds. When client and server don't communicate to each other for 5 seconds, they are considered to be disconnected.So yeah that was all there is to configure for now.  Follow the next steps of the configuration or feel free to skip them if you don't own the **PLUS** version. They will explain how the *PLUS* version  (or udphp to be precise) enables you to connect to other players even behind a firewall and why you might want the *PLUS* version or *udphp* if you don't already own it.---**» Next topic: [PLUS - Setup udphp](tutorial/2_udphp1)**« Previous topic: [What is HTME?](tutorial/0_whatishtme)
