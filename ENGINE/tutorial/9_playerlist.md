##9. Overlay that shows the name of connected players

We will now create a list that is displayed in the top left corner of the screen and will look something like this:

![A preview of the player list](images/3.PNG)

**Create a new object** ``htme_obj_playerlist`` with no sprite, make it persistent so it exists in both game rooms, and **place it** in ``htme_rom_demo``.

This new object is actually not going to be added to the engine. This object will simply look for all existing ``htme_obj_player`` instances and write their metadata on the screen.

The only thing we'll need is a **Draw-Event**.  
Let's start with drawing the word "Players:" on screen:
```javascript
draw_set_color(c_white);
draw_text(40,35,"Players:");
```

Okay, cool, cool. But how on earth do we get all player instances? There are two possibilites:

1. You could use ``with htme_obj_player {/*Code*/}`` to loop through all player instances
2. The engine provides some tools to get a list of all connected players and a function to get an instance that is controlled by a particular player.

In our case the first solution is the easiest. However we want to teach you what you can do with the engine, and so **we are going to use the second method**. There might be cases where looping through all instances of an object would be simply to much, for example if you have a race game with 2 players and 6 cpus and you only want to get data of the connected players.

```javascript
var playerlist = htme_getPlayers();
```

This will give you a ``ds_list`` containing the hashes of all players. Each player is identifed by a random 8 character hash.

To loop over this list, add the following for-loop:

```javascript
for(var i = 0;i<ds_list_size(playerlist);i++) {
    var player = ds_list_find_value(playerlist,i);
}
```

``player`` will now be the playerhash of a player. We use this hash to get a player instance of this player. **Inside the for loop after ``var player =...`` insert the following:**

```javascript
var instance = htme_findPlayerInstance(htme_obj_player,player);
```

This will either **return an instance or -**1. It will **return -1 when the player is in another room**, because no instance for this player exists. **And that's a problem**.

Because that means we can't actually get the name of the player to display it then. That's a limitation because we store the player name with our player object. After this tutorial is over you should be able to solve this issue, and I challenge you to do so!

Because of this limitation we will simply show "(other room)" in a grey color, when the player instance does not exist:

```javascript
if (instance != -1) {
    var name = (instance).name;
    var _image_blend = (instance).image_blend;
} else {
    var name = "(Other room)";
    var _image_blend = c_gray;
}
```

**``name`` now contains the name of the current player and ``_image_blend`` the color.**

**The following code will draw the sprite and the name:**

```javascript
//Draw small player icon
draw_sprite_ext(htme_spr_player,0,50,(i)*20+70,0.5,0.5,0,_image_blend,1);
//Draw player name
draw_set_colour(_image_blend);
draw_text(70,(i)*20+62,name);
```

Remember, all of this must go into the for-loop.

Start the game and test it out, our player list should work just fine.
